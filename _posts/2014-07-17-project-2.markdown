description: UberCoral.com is an ecommerce site for selling exotic corals and fish. My objective with this project is to learn and discover possible tools for developing small e-commerce web apps. My goal is to create an affordable e-commmerce solution for small business owners that are interested in reaching more clients through the online market. <br><br>The backend is powered a CMS called Strapi. <strong><a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi.io</a></strong> is a modern headless CMS based on Node.JS. The CMS allows the site owner to create, update, and delete contents without relying on a technical expert that maybe cost prohabited to retain on payroll. It also provides a nice GUI for inventory management. Overall, I learned a great deal about Strapi and the power of modern headless CMS. I look forward to creating real world solutions with this amazing tool.
