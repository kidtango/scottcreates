summary: Uber Corals is an e-commerce app built with React.JS for responsive user interface and  Node.JS API/Strapi CMS for super fast & scalable backend.
description: Uber Corals is an e-commerce store for selling exotic corals and fish. My objective with this project is to learn and discover possible tools for developing small e-commerce web apps. My goal is to create an affordable e-commmerce solution for small business owners that are interested in reaching more clients through the online market. <br><br>The backend is powered by a content management system(CMS) called Strapi. <strong><a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi.io</a></strong> is a modern headless CMS based on Node.JS. The CMS allows the site owner to create, update, and delete contents without relying on a technical expert that maybe cost prohabitive to retain on payroll. It also provides a nice GUI for content management.
technical_challenges: My greatest challenge with this project is to setup the development enviroment for Strapi API, and have it plays nicely with the remote MongoDB hosted on mLab. That took a day of Googling and browsing through Stack Overflow to find the solutions.
lessions_learned: I discovered that the online community of developers around the world are my best resources. I ran into many technical challenges along the path, and couldn't possibly continue on with the project without answers from resources such as Stack Overflow and offical documenations.
