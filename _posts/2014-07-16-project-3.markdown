description: SuperSick Fits is an e-commmerce web app designed for a small online store. I get to experiment with creating a GraphQL/Node.JS API with features such as JWT based authentication for user authorization, and building a relational data structure to handle complex business logics. <br><br> The data flow from the backend to the frontend is facilitate by Apollo Server and Client. <strong><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apolo GraphQL</a></strong> provides a more streamline process for querying data, and it replaces many API endpoints with a single versatile query system.
