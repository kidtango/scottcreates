description: My goal for Tweef.io is to create a social-media platform for the reef keeping community. Tweef provides a mean for vendors and hobbyists to share their love for marine animals. <br><br>In addition to sharing info, Tweef provides a marketplace for the members to sell corals and equipment. Most importantly, my vision is to provide a platform for hobbyists to share the beauty of their tanks, and their love for the hobby.<br><br> The dream feature that I would like to implement in the near future is to link live videos of all the tanks. In this way, members can view reef tanks from around the world as they go through their light cycles. <br><br> This project solidifies my understanding of GraphQL and how it works with frameworks such as Node.JS, React.JS, and other support libararies. I was able to create a GraphQL API that handles complex data relationships that allow for users to be authenticated, perform CRUD functions such as creating, & deleting comments, and much more. <br><br> On the client side, GraphQL allows for very precise querying of data, which eases the complexity of creating UI functionalies. A good case for GraphQL is the implimentation of cursor based pagination. I was able to quickly query for the first set of data, while queuing up the next set without too much complexity as far as the coding is concerned. The concept is straight forward, and all the info needed is clearly explained on <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">GraphQL Apollo's</a> site.<br><br>One of the biggest challenges that I'm facing at the moment with this project is to gain more info on market interest. How should I design the main entry point for the app? Should it behave more like Instagram or Facebook? <br><br> On the technical side, the challenge is to complete the prototype of the app and have it hosted securely. Another challenge is to create a mobile version. Should I use Flutter, React Native, or other mobile frameworks? Overall, I'm very happy with the lessions learned and the technical knowledge acquired. I've deepened my understanding of how data is queried from the frontend to backend, user authentication using JWT token, handling sessions, and etc.
