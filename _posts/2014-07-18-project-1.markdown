description: My goal for Tweef.io is to create a social-media platform for the reef keeping community. Tweef provides a mean for vendors and hobbyists to share their love for marine animals. <br><br>In addition to sharing info, Tweef provides a marketplace for the members to sell corals and equipment. Most importantly, my vision is to provide a platform for hobbyists to share the beauty of their tanks, and their love for the hobby.<br><br> The dream feature that I would like to implement in the near future is to link live videos of all the tanks. In this way, members can view reef tanks from around the world as they go through their light cycles.
