summary: SuperSick Fits is a Next.JS/Node.JS app that's glued together with Apollo GraphQL built for modern e-commerce.
description: I get to experiment with creating a GraphQL/Node.JS API with features such as JWT based authentication for user authorization, and building a relational data structure to handle complex business logics. <br><br> The data flow from the backend to the frontend is facilitate by Apollo Server and Client. <strong><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo GraphQL</a></strong> provides a more streamline process for querying data, and it replaces many API endpoints with a single versatile query system. <br><br> And finally, payment is processed through Stripe, so that sensitive data are not saved to PostgreSQL database. Basic information such as names, shipping, and email addresses are saved to PostgreSQL for authethnication and other business needs.
