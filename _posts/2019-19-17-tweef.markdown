description: My goal for Tweef.io is to create a social-media platform for the reef keeping community. Tweef provides a mean for vendors and hobbyists to share their love for marine animals. <br><br>In addition to sharing info, Tweef acts a market place for vendors and hobbyist to sell & trade. <br><br> Tweef is in an early stage of prototyping and development. I'm gathering feedback from the community with the prototype to iron out certain concepts and features of the app.
